# Greed Dice Game

A multiplayer dice game where players roll five dice to accumulate points. The first player to reach 3000 points triggers a final round where all other players get one last turn.

## Game Rules

- Players must score at least 300 points in a single turn to start tracking their score
- Once a player reaches 3000 points, all other players get one final turn
- Players can choose to re-roll non-scoring dice to potentially increase their turn score

### Scoring
- Three 1s = 1000 points
- Three of any other number = number Ã— 100 points
- Single 1 = 100 points  
- Single 5 = 50 points
- All other dice score 0 points

## Running the Game

ruby start_game.rb
